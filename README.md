Algorithms and Data Structures (IN711) at Otago Polytechnic

This repository is for the Algorithms and Data Structures paper at Otago Polytechnic in Dunedin, New Zealand.
Students enrolled in this paper should clone this repository.  It comprises your assigned coding work for the 
semester.

If you are not a student in my paper, you may find the material interesting and you should feel free to use it.

If you are an educator and wish to use this material in your own teaching practice, you are also free to do so.
I ask that you contact me and let me know where and how you use it and give me feedback. If you have improvements
to offer, patches are welcome.

Cheers,
Tom Clark
